# Contributing to Atomikos TransactionsEssentials

Thank you very much for considering a contribution to our project! 

Please follow the guidelines on this page to make things go smooth...

## Most Wanted

We're happy with all the help we can get (and you want to give), but we think that the following would be the most useful contributions:

 - Vote on existing feature requests you need most - so we know which ones are priority for the community.
 - Give feedback on planned features before we build them - so we can avoid implementing useless things.
 - Report on missing features so we can make our product better for you. Better still: send us a PR with the implementation.
 - Did you already fork and make changes for yourself? Why not send us a PR to check if we can use this, too.
 - Report bugs - so we can maximize stability (or even better if you can: send us a PR with a fix). 
 - Create some visibility by starring the project, blogging about it, ...

## How to Request a Feature

## How to Contribute Code (Features or Fixes)

 1. If you need inspiration: check our open issues with contribution labels (i.e., ["good first issue"](https://github.com/atomikos/transactions-essentials/labels/good%20first%20issue) or ["help wanted"](https://github.com/atomikos/transactions-essentials/labels/help%20wanted))...
 1. Implement a minimal set of changes in your fork of our sources.
 1. Create a pull request for us to merge.
 1. As part of the pull request, you will be asked to accept our contributor license terms.
  

## Other Ways to Contribute

 1. Vote on issues you find useful - this will help us prioritize work for the future releases!
 1. Give feedback on planned features before we build them - so we can do them the right way.
 1. Help us grow this community by [recommending us](https://www.atomikos.com/Main/RecommendUs) or starring this repository.
 1. Feel free to share bug reports, usage problems or clarity issues...
 1. Help us learn: [share your story](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XMS5987) so we can use your insight to improve the project.
 1. Share configuration examples (or other useful documentation) on our [documentation wiki](https://www.atomikos.com/Documentation).
 1. Write a blog post about how you use this project.
 1. Request a new feature if you find that useful functionality is missing.
 1. Consider getting a paid subscription so we (Atomikos) can continue working full-time on this technology :-)

## How Pull Requests Can Get Accepted
 
 - We review every pull request, although it may take a while.
 - Please respond to any questions why might have - so we can accept your pull request.
 - Issues for which we had questions but receive no answer within 2 weeks will likely be closed without being incorporated.
 - Accepted pull requests require post-processing on our end, because we typically add the required tests to our test suites. We'll probably also change the code here and there to match our design style.

## What If... My Pull Request Is Rejected?

It happens, don't take it personally: 

 - Our open source work is only sustainable because of the money we make on commercial support and power features, so we may reject pull requests that we believe to be in conflict with our commercial distribution. Otherwise, there would not be this open source code base to contribute to in the first place... 
 - We try to keep the product scope focused so we may also reject pull requests that we feel are not aligned with our long-term vision.

You can also look at it in a positive way: here on github it is easy to fork and modify whatever you like, so the project fits your specific needs. In some cases, those needs overlap with our vision and that's the perfect pull request. In other cases, there is not much overlap - but then you still have your fork with your custom changes. That's a lot better than in the past, when we did not have a public repository at all.

_Thanks for your understanding!_
