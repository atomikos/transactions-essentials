BTW we're really honoured to receive your help, but please understand that some pull requests may be rejected for several reasons - in particular because it might conflict with the commercial offerings of Atomikos. Without making money on something, we would not have been able to give TransactionsEssentials for free in the first place! Thanks for understanding..._
